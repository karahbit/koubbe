README - Testing FACTS module on XSEDE Resources

Date produced: 11 December 2019
By: Gregory Garner

This archive provides the necessary files to run a single workflow through FACTS that
can be used to test running FACTS on XSEDE.

1)  Clone the FACTS repository
2)  Copy the contents of this archive to the appropriate locations
  - Copy './experiments/test_xsede' to the '/experiments/' directory in FACTS
  - Copy './modules/kopp14/landwaterstorage/data/*.tgz' to '/modules/kopp14/landwaterstorage/data/' in FACTS
3)  Update the resource file to match the appropriate parameters for XSEDE resources
  - Resource file is '/experiments/test_xsede/resource.yml'
4) pip install numpy pyyaml radical.entk radical.analytics
5)  Run FACTS
  - From the FACTS root directory, run 'python FACTS.py ./experiments/test_xsede/'

Note: Must run FACTS with Python 2.7.x

Note: When I run this locally, radical.pilot times out the first time. Attempting to run
FACTS again usually works.

Once the run is done, the directory '/experiments/test_xsede/output/' should have been 
generated with two output files:

1) "landwaterstorage1-kopp14-landwaterstorage_globalsl.nc"
2) "landwaterstorage1-kopp14-landwaterstorage_localsl.nc"

If these two files are present, then everything worked as expected!

Please let me know if you have any questions.
