FACTS:
- Have been helping Greg with running simple "modules" on XSEDE Bridges,
  and verifying correct functionality.
- Work in progress: Branching from the repo, packaging and merging back.

Containers:
- After studying Boutiques, I have learned that it can be useful for deploying 
  RCT inside a container image. However, for my immediate goal of characterizing
  performance of containerized tasks through RP, I am going to leave Boutiques
  temporarily on a side.
- Work in progress: For the above goal, I have been working on the design of the 
  necessary experiments to be run, as well as performing said experiments.
