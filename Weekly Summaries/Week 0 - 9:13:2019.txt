\f0\fs24 \cf0 Week 0 - 9/13/2019\
\
I had initial meetings with Shantenu and Matteo to discuss the path from where I have to start. I read the article on Scaling Deep Learning for Science and the paper on Evolving Deep Networks Using HPC. Also read previous student\'92s work on HyperSpace, and started reading about the concept of containers, their purpose and how to install them and use them. I started with Docker, since I want to gain deeper knowledge of it so I can then make analogies and compare to Singularity.\
\
On the technical side, I learned how to access Jetstream Atmosphere from my Mac Terminal and from there, SSH Bridges. Installed Anaconda and RCT on the VM instance and ran my first example on RP.\
\
I have arranged weekly meetings with Matteo every Tuesday at 2 pm (face to face). Devel meetings on same day at 4 pm (at lab).}
