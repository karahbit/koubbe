I have been working on making Singularity containerized MPI applications work
on Bridges. 

In order for it to work, there are two approaches on building the
container: Hybrid mode and Bind mode. Hybrid mode needs to have the same MPI
implementation installed on both host and container. Bind mode allows the use of
the MPI of the host by using bindings given at the execution of the container.

This week, I have been trying to make both of them work with the three MPI 
implementations available on Bridges: Intel MPI, Open MPI and MPICH.

The first implementation that I tried was Open MPI, and after some trickery it 
worked fine on both modes for single node. However, it is not working on 
multiple nodes. I even opened tickets on Singularity and Bridges support 
regarding the issue. I think that the Open MPI version on Bridges is too old and
newer versions offer better support for Singularity. Working with Intel and 
MPICH now, I was able to make them both work on hybrid and bind mode.

Conclusion: For now, we are able to create Singularity containers from scratch,
install all that we need from a definition file, including MPI, and launch our 
applications on Bridges. Or simply we could grab any container base image like 
Centos and bind mount MPI into it at execution time.

Next step: I am going to stick with Intel since that is the default on Bridges
and proceed (finally) to do performance comparison with non containerized
applications via RP on Bridges.
