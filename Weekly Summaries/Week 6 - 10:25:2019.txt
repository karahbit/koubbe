HPO:
1. Started thinking and elaborating Functional Requirements Document (FRD) for HPO Module of RADICAL-Learning library
2. I want to run first program using HyperSpace on a specific use case (e.g., Jumanaâ€™s) and make sure we are good until that point.

Containers:

1. Installed, created, imported and used first containerized application using Singularity on Comet
2. This question still needs answer:
What is boutiques (Tristan)? What can we learn from it? Should we spent time on it?
