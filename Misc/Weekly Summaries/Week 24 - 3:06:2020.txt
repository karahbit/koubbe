This week I successfully submitted the jobs regarding my experiments with Singularity containerization of MPI applications via RP on Bridges HPC cluster.

While I wait for my results, I dedicated a few days to update documentation and instructions about everything I have been doing in the lab. You can see the readme on my Github repo:

Moreover, I attended the Containers @ TACC seminar this Friday, in where they talk about Docker, Singularity and MPI parallelism on TACC Stampede2.
