RCT:

Played with RCT analytics to extract TTC, TTX, overheads times and plots on basic examples.



HPO:

1. Compiled a list of HPO engines.

2. Based on ease of use, search space options, algorithms, documentation, and visualization, decided to start exploration with Scikit-Optimize.

3. Deep study of HyperSpace: what it is, what it does and how it does it.

4. HyperSpace only needs to:
1. Define an objective function.
2. Define a parameter search space.
3. Call one of HyperSpace’s minimization functions, passing it the objective function and search space.

5. Answered the question: At what level do we introduce concurrency for our optimization, at EnTK level or at task level?
R: the logical path to follow is to treat each hyperspace optimization as an independent task, and set up a bag (stage) of tasks inside a single pipeline. With this, we take full advantage of EnTK and achieve concurrency at EnTK level, while still making use of HyperSpaceâ€™s spaces creation and optimization through Scikit-Optimize.

Containers:

1. I followed tutorial on singularity. Still need to install on Comet:

2. This question needs answer:
What is boutiques (Tristan)? What can we learn from it? Should we spent time on it?



FACTS:
Followed tutorial on Python Packaging:
