FACTS:
- During the meeting this weekend, we addressed Greg's questions regarding EnTK 
  API and also discussed some further steps regarding Singularity, like How are we
  going to distribute containers to end users

Concordia meeting:
I agreed to investigate further the following topics regarding Singularity:
- Again, what are all the possible reasons for Singularityâ€™s constant overhead? 
  I/O? Filesystem? Container bootstrapping?
- Experiment with bandwidth/latency MPI inside the container
- Experiment with Bind and Hybrid mode performance comparison 

CHEERS hpo progress:
- I am behind on reporting progress for this project. I need to accelerate the 
  pace and provide a meaningful update in the next coming days.

  Misc:
  - Graduation is done! All papers have been submitted, nothing else to do here.
