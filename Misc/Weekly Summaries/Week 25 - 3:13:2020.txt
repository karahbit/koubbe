FACTS:
I followed some tutorials regarding Python unit testing in order to help Greg write some unit tests 
for the FACTS main code. I also offered him help regarding the transition to Python 3, so that is in
the works as well.

Containers:
I finally finished obtaining results from Bridges about the performance comparison of containerized 
MPI applications. You can see it on the slides in the Container section of my GitHub repo.

HPO:
I started retaking work on the HPO library. For this, I am planning on submitting HyperSpace tasks
via RCT to verify correct functionality. After this, I will start with the implementation of the library.

Misc:
Finished last touches of my GitHub repo documentation of what I have so far.
