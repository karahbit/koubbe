Containers:
- This week I gave my initial presentation showing background and results regarding containerization on HPCs via RCT.
- Given the feedback received for the presentation, I have been adjusting the workflow of my experiments to include error bars (10 runs for each experiment)
- I continue running the multiple combination of experiments on Bridges in order to give an update on results next week.

FACTS:
