Containers:
- Regarding MPI stressing and running on Comet, unfortunately I have been trying
  to request resources to submit my jobs all week but they are giving priority to 
  COVID-19 research, so I am waiting in the meantime.

HPO:
- I read the respective papers again to refresh myself in this area.
- Integrated HyperSpace with EnTK and submitted jobs locally succesully, with
  following issue:
- Work done on HyperSpace is a bit outdated, does not work anymore out of the
  box, and needs to be rewritten in order to support newer libraries. I have
  been in touch with Todd Young (developer of HyperSpace) regarding this matter.
  In any case, I need to take this into consideration at the time of implementing
  radical.hpo to provide support for the newest packages.
