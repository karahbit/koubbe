MacOS: Access new temporary Jetstream VM until three.radical-project.org is up and running:

On local machine

1) Generate ssh keys:
 $ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -a 100

2) Copy the public key to the remote machine (I must have an account here already):
 $ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub karahbit@129.114.17.185

3) Avoid enter the password every time by adding the following to the .ssh/config (create one if it doesn't exist):

Host *
	AddKeysToAgent yes 
	IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

Alternatively, On a *nix system (therefore also on MacOS) you canâ€‹ do the same with:
 $ ssh-agent -t 3600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

4) Forward the agent to the remote machine automatically every time by adding the following to your .ssh/conf:

Host 129.114.17.185
	ForwardAgent yes

5) Log in to the remote machine and start working:
 $ ssh karahbit@129.114.17.185
