George:

As discussed:


Here are the three applications (at  a minimum) that I suggested you write to get familiar with EnTK:
 
 — 128 tasks concurrently, where each task is 1 core  
 — 8 tasks where each task is 16 cores 
 — 16 concurrent batches of 8 tasks (each of 1 core), but where in each batch each task runs sequentially, i.e., one after the other.

(The duration of the tasks can be arbitrary short).
 
Please start on a machine of your liking but please do run eventually on an XSEDE superocmputer.

Please do consult:
